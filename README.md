## Initial TODOS:  

### Peter
- Finish out boiler plate
  - requirements.txt
  - venv (dogs)

### Kahaf
- ~~Look into graph scaling~~
- ~~Consider a horizontal approach~~
- See if we can get rid of any zoom feature on the figure, we should be able to scroll on it
- ~~Currently the bars are too small for the x axis and only some names are popping up~~
- Pagination and caching to try and optimize the speed of the app.
- Lazy loading?

### Veronica
- ~~Merge Test_map2.py functionality with dog_names.py~~
