## [Link to dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Dog-Licensing-Dataset/nu7n-tubp)

# Initial TODOS:  

Peter-   
    Finish out boiler plate:  
        req.txt  
        venv (dogs)  
Kahaf-  
    Look into graph scaling  
    consider a horizontal approach  
    See if we can get rid of any zoom feature on the figure, we should be able to scroll on it  
        Currently the bars are too small for the x axis and only some names are popping up  
Veronica-  
    Merge Test_map2.py functionality with dog_names.py
